### Fixing Typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the source file.

* NO: you edit an automatically generated file (e.g., `.pyc`, cache, or output files).

### Prerequisites

### Pull Request Process
